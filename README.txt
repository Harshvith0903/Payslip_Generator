# Payslip Generation System

This project is a Python-based system for generating employee payslips. It processes employee data from an Excel file and generates corresponding payslips. The project appears to integrate with Gradio for a web-based interface.

## Features
- Upload an Excel file containing employee details.
- Generate payslips for employees based on predefined templates.
- Web-based interface using Gradio.
- Store and retrieve processed payslips.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `payslip.py`)

### Steps to Install and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Payslip
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:

## Folder Structure
```
Payslip/
│── payslip.py                # Main script for processing payslips
│── employee_data.xlsx        # Sample employee data
│── .gradio/                  # Stores Gradio-related data
│   ├── certificate.pem       # SSL certificate (if applicable)
│   ├── flagged/              # Stores flagged data
│── .git/                     # Version control files
```

## Usage
1. Upload the `employee_data.xlsx` file via the interface (if using Gradio).
2. The script processes employee data and generates payslips.
3. Download the generated payslips from the output directory.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate email delivery of payslips.
- Improve UI for better usability.
- Add a database for persistent storage.
